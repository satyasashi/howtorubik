This is a Basic Tutorial Site for people who want to learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube by reading the posts or by watching the 
videos.

# Site Status
This site started as my personal project to implement my knowledge on Python, Django and other Frontend technologies
like HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap. And this site is still in progress and will be updated with good content to learn
in a while.
